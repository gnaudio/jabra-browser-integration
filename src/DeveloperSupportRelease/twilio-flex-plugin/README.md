# Your custom Twilio Flex Plugin

Twilio Flex Plugins allow you to customize the apperance and behavior of [Twilio Flex](https://www.twilio.com/flex). If you want to learn more about the capabilities and how to use the API, check out our [Flex documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex).

## Setup

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) as well as [`npm`](https://npmjs.com) installed.

Make a copy of `public/appConfig.example.js` rename it `public/appConfig.js`, in the file, fill in the `accountSid`, with your Twilio Flex `accountSid`.
Make a copy of `.env.example` rename it `.env`, fill in the `REACT_APP_ES_HOST` with an elastic search host url, and fill in `REACT_APP_KIBANA_HOST` with a kibana host url.

Afterwards install the dependencies by running `npm install`:

```
npm install
```

## Development

In order to develop locally, you can use the Webpack Dev Server by running:

```bash
npm start
```

This will automatically start up the Webpack Dev Server and open the browser for you. Your app will run on `http://localhost:3000`. If you want to change that you can do this by setting the `PORT` environment variable:

```bash
PORT=3000 npm start
```

When you make changes to your code, the browser window will be automatically refreshed. Note that automatic device selection won't work on http.

## Deploy

Once you are happy with your plugin, you have to bundle it, in order to deply it to Twilio Flex.

Run the following command to start the bundling:

```bash
npm run build
```

Afterwards, you'll find in your project a `build/` folder that contains a file with the name of your plugin project. For example `plugin-jabra.js`. Take this file and upload it into the Assets part of your Twilio Runtime.

Note: Common packages like `React`, `ReactDOM`, `Redux` and `ReactRedux` are not bundled with the build because they are treated as external dependencies so the plugin will depend on Flex which would provide them globally.
