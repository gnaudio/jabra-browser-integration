# Change information.

Here are listed changes for (1) Javascript API, (2) Browser extension and (3) native chromehost installation components.

# 1. JAVASCRIPT API

3.0.0

- fixes error in finding compatible Jabra devices for getUserDeviceMediaExt 
- new unring command
- pass optional boolean (true) to onhook and offhook commands to continue ringer (default behaviour is to stop the ringer)
- Various bugfixes.
- Added analytics module (preview)
- Added npm module support.
- Optional string types removed in TS declarations. Clients should now use the correct types instead of strings.
- Added meta-data for APIs.
- Improved API test application to support multiple objects, documentation, alignment with similar node.js test application.

2.0.1. Fixed the following in the Javascript API

- Installation check bug fix - would falsely report that installation was corrupt in some cases.
- Workaround for typescript 3.4 problem.

2.0 Added/changed the following

- Added [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) definitions `jabra.browser.integration-2.0.d.ts` of API for detailed documentation, static checking and better IDE support. _Tip: Use the typescript file with a [reference path comment](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/triple-slash-directives.html) on top of your javascript files to get code completion for the Jabra API in many development tools._
- Modern ES5+ promisified Javascript API - All methods now return values using [Javascript promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) rather than callbacks in order to enabled streamlined testing and API usage. This means for instance, the `init()` method now returns a JS promise that user should use then()/catch() on to react on initialization. In addition, methods that performs side-effects return void promises
  to enable clients to synchronize **(breaking change)**.
- Individual subscription to event(s) using `addEventListener(nameSpec, callback)` and `removeEventListenernameSpec, callback)` **(breaking change)**.
- Removed requestEnum. Use of individual subscription event handlers (see above) abolish the need for this enumeration **(breaking change)**.
- `getActiveDevice()` now return a JS object with detailed information rather than a simple number **(breaking change)**.
- `getDevices()` now return a JS array of objects with detailed information rather than a simple string **(breaking change)**.
- `setActiveDevice` renamed to `setActiveDeviceId` to reflect that it takes an ID as argument rather than a detailed object like `getActiveDevice()` returns.
- `getUserDeviceMedia()` has been removed. Use `getUserDeviceMediaExt` instead.
- `getDeviceInfo()` has been deleted. Use ``getActiveDevice(true)` instead.
- Added `getInstallInfo()` that checks and details the current installation.
- Added `setMmiFocus` to do custom button handling for supported devices (MMIv2).
- Added `setRemoteMmiLightAction` to change button colors (MMIv2).
- Added shutdown method (for use in testing).
- Fixed various bugs, incl. a race-condition where incorrect results would be given.
- Better support for multiple devices.
- Added >30 more events.
- Added logging to API, browser extension and chromehost executable.
- Added API test example, updated existing examples for new API version.
- All internals are now hidden away so they can't be accessed by accident.
